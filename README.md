# Bake My Cake – React Single Page Application

A beautifully designed **bakery-themed React application** that displays a variety of cakes, cupcakes, brownies, cookies, and chocolates. The UI is inspired by premium patisserie websites with pastel colors, modern fonts, and elegant layouts.

This project uses **json-server** to fetch product data dynamically and React components to render interactive UI sections such as Hero banner, Signature cakes, Holiday collection, and product grids.
